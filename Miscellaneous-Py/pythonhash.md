# Python program to take input, convert to tuple and print the hash value

Hash values are integers assigned data types

A hashable object is one that has a hash value constant through its entire lifetime

All immutable built-in objects are hashable

Hashable can be used as dictionaries and are used to compare keys based on program demands

Lists and dictionaries are non-hashable since they are mutable and hence cannot be used as keys

Tuples are hashable since immutable
